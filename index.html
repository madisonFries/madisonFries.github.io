<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Madison Fries but I go by Maddie. I'm currently seventeen years old. 
    I'm from Kettering, Ohio. I’ve been in Color guard for the last four years. I have 
    2 seasons in Winter guard and 4 seasons in Color guard. The shows I have been in for 
    color guard are, All Wound Up, All Wound Up part 2, Everest, Maps and Legends, 
    Concrete Jungle, and Love Letter. In Love Letter I was casted as the lead of thre show. 
    I had many solos throughout the show. My favorite show I performed in was Love Letter.	
    I went to every football game during my highschool career. I  marched pre-game and halftime.

<p>I’ve been really big into gaming for 6 years now. I’ve always gamed on my 
    Playstation four and Playstation three. The games I play the most are GTA 5, 
    The Forest, Red Dead Redemption, and 7 Days to Die.  During the past four years
     I have been in high school I have donated blood three times to recieve my red cord. 
     My favorite place to go get coffee is Starbucks. When I'm With my friends I go to 
     Dunkin with them even though it’s not my favorite place. I have my own car that my 
     friends like to call the pumpkin carriage since it’s orange. My car is Halloween 
     themed because of its color. 
</p>

<p>	My favorite artist to listen to is Taylor Swift. I listen to her everytime I get 
    in my car. My favorite song by her is How You Get The Girl. I went to the Eras Tour 
    in Cincinati on July 1st. My favorite store is Forever 21. My two favorite colors 
    are pink and orange. I love to write in pink and orange erasable pens. The social media 
    platform I use the most is Snapchat. I love getting my nails done in fun colors. I 
    really love making art pieces since it makes me get really creative.
